# Good-Seed-Supermarket-Computer-Vision-Based-System

## **Description of the Problem:**
Good Seed, a supermarket chain, faces the challenge of accurately estimating customer age using computer vision from checkout camera images to comply with alcohol sales regulations. 

## **Project Goal:**
The project aims to refine the age estimation model by reducing the mean absolute error through further optimization and improved data quality. The goal is to achieve a sufficiently accurate system that minimizes misclassifications, thereby enhancing regulatory compliance and preventing the sale of alcohol to underage individuals.

## **Tools and Libraries:**
- Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.
- TensorFlow & Keras: Build and train deep learning models, perform image preprocessing (using ImageDataGenerator), and leverage pre-trained models.
- Numpy: Perform numerical operations and handle array-based computations.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Create visualizations and charts for data exploration and presentation.
- PIL (Pillow): Manage and process images.
  
## **Data Documentation:**
The dataset was obtained from ChaLearn Looking at People. The information given is as follows:
- labels: dataset
- file_name: image name  
- real_age: real age of the person
